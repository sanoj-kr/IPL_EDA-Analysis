# EDA Analysis on IPL Dataset

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Indian Premier League (IPL)** dataset, which includes data from all IPL matches played between 2008 and 2018. The main objective of this analysis is to uncover meaningful insights into the patterns and trends of the IPL using Python and the Pandas library.

## Datasets Used
Two datasets were used for this analysis:

1. **Matches Dataset**
   - Provides detailed information on every match played between 2008 and 2018.
   - Key columns include:
     - Season
     - Venue
     - City
     - Teams
     - Match Winner
     - Toss Winner
     - Umpires

2. **Deliveries Dataset**
   - Contains ball-by-ball data for each match played during the same period.
   - Key columns include:
     - Runs Scored Per Ball
     - Extras by Bowlers/Fielding Team
     - Wickets Taken
     - Types of Dismissals

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization)
  
## Steps Performed
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handling missing data.
   - Standardizing data formats (e.g., city and venue names).
   - Removing irrelevant or duplicate information.

2. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removing null values.
   - Correcting inconsistencies in data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analysis of match statistics, trends across seasons, and team performances.
   - Examination of batting and bowling metrics, including runs per ball, types of dismissals, and wicket-taking strategies.
   - Insights on toss impact, venue performance, and key player statistics.

## Key Insights Derived
- Trends and performance metrics of teams over the years.
- Patterns related to match-winning factors such as toss outcomes and venues.
- A deep dive into individual player performance, types of dismissals, and bowler effectiveness.

## Conclusion
This EDA project on IPL data provides useful insights into match outcomes, team dynamics, and player performances over the years. It showcases how data analysis techniques can reveal hidden patterns and help understand large-scale sporting events like the IPL.
